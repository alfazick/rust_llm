# Self-Consistency Technique: Theoretical Example

This example illustrates how the Self-Consistency technique might work on a simple math word problem.

## Problem Statement

Let's use the following problem:

"If a train travels at 60 miles per hour, how far will it travel in 2.5 hours?"

## Step 1: Generate Multiple Reasoning Paths

The LLM is prompted to solve this problem multiple times (let's say 5 times) using Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Here are potential outputs:

### Path 1:
1. The train's speed is 60 miles per hour.
2. The time of travel is 2.5 hours.
3. Distance = Speed × Time
4. Distance = 60 × 2.5
5. Distance = 150 miles
Therefore, the answer is 150 miles.

### Path 2:
1. We need to multiply the speed by the time.
2. Speed is 60 mph and time is 2.5 hours.
3. 60 × 2.5 = 120 + 30 = 150
Therefore, the answer is 150 miles.

### Path 3:
1. In 1 hour, the train travels 60 miles.
2. In 2 hours, it would travel 120 miles.
3. In the remaining 0.5 hours, it travels half of 60, which is 30 miles.
4. Total distance = 120 + 30 = 150 miles
Therefore, the answer is 150 miles.

### Path 4:
1. Let's break it down:
   - For 2 hours: 60 × 2 = 120 miles
   - For 0.5 hours: 60 × 0.5 = 30 miles
2. Total: 120 + 30 = 150 miles
Therefore, the answer is 150 miles.

### Path 5:
1. Distance = Rate × Time
2. Rate = 60 mph
3. Time = 2.5 hours
4. Distance = 60 × 2.5
5. Distance = 150 miles
Therefore, the answer is 150 miles.

## Step 2: Extract Answers

From each path, we extract the final answer:

1. 150 miles
2. 150 miles
3. 150 miles
4. 150 miles
5. 150 miles

## Step 3: Determine Most Consistent Answer

In this case, all paths led to the same answer of 150 miles. The Self-Consistency technique would confidently return this as the final answer.

## Analysis

This example demonstrates several key aspects of the Self-Consistency technique:

1. **Multiple Approaches**: Each path takes a slightly different approach to solving the problem, showcasing how the technique explores various reasoning strategies.

2. **Consistency**: In this case, all paths arrived at the same answer, providing high confidence in the result. In real-world scenarios, there might be some variation, and the most frequent answer would be chosen.

3. **Robustness**: If one path had made a calculation error, the consensus from the other paths would likely override it, demonstrating the technique's robustness to individual mistakes.

4. **Verification**: The consistency across multiple paths serves as a form of self-verification, increasing confidence in the final answer.

In more complex problems, the benefits of Self-Consistency become even more apparent, as it can navigate ambiguities and catch errors that might persist in a single reasoning attempt.
