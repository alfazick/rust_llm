# Self-Consistency Prompting Technique

## Introduction

Self-Consistency is an advanced prompting method that builds upon the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Introduced by Wang et al. (2022), this approach addresses the limitations of single-path reasoning by leveraging multiple reasoning paths to arrive at more robust and accurate answers.

## Theoretical Foundation

The Self-Consistency technique is based on several key insights:

1. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: Complex reasoning problems often have multiple valid solution paths.
2. **Stochastic Nature of LLMs**: The non-deterministic nature of LLM outputs can be leveraged to explore diverse reasoning paths.
3. **Consistency as a Proxy for Correctness**: Answers that appear consistently across multiple reasoning attempts are more likely to be correct.

## Algorithm

The Self-Consistency method consists of three main steps:

1. Generate multiple reasoning paths using Chain-of-Thought prompting.
2. Sample diverse outputs from the LLM for each path.
3. Aggregate the results to determine the most consistent answer.

## Implementation in Rust

Below is a Rust implementation that demonstrates the core concepts of the Self-Consistency technique:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

struct LLM;

impl LLM {
    fn generate(&self, prompt: &str) -> String {
        // Simulated LLM generation
        // In a real implementation, this would call an actual LLM API
        format!("Reasoning: Step 1...\nStep 2...\nTherefore, the answer is 42")
    }
}

fn self_consistency(prompt: &str, num_samples: usize) -> String {
    let llm = LLM;
    let mut paths = Vec::new();
    
    for _ in 0..num_samples {
        let path = cot_prompt(&llm, prompt);
        paths.push(path);
    }
    
    let answers: Vec<String> = paths.iter()
        .map(|path| extract_answer(path))
        .collect();
    
    most_common(&answers)
}

fn cot_prompt(llm: &LLM, prompt: &str) -> String {
    llm.generate(&format!("{}\nLet's approach this step-by-step:", prompt))
}

fn extract_answer(reasoning_path: &str) -> String {
    reasoning_path.split("Therefore, the answer is ")
        .last()
        .unwrap_or("")
        .to_string()
}

fn most_common(answers: &[String]) -> String {
    let mut count_map = HashMap::new();
    for answer in answers {
        *count_map.entry(answer).or_insert(0) += 1;
    }
    count_map.into_iter()
        .max_by_key(|&(_, count)| count)
        .map(|(answer, _)| answer.clone())
        .unwrap_or_else(|| String::from("No consistent answer found"))
}

fn main() {
    let prompt = "What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?";
    let result = self_consistency(prompt, 5);
    println!("Most consistent answer: {}", result);
}
```

## Key Components

1. **LLM Struct**: Simulates a large language model. In a real-world scenario, this would interface with an actual LLM API.

2. **self_consistency Function**: Implements the core algorithm:
   - Generates multiple reasoning paths
   - Extracts answers from each path
   - Determines the most consistent answer

3. **cot_prompt Function**: Applies the Chain-of-Thought technique to the initial prompt, encouraging step-by-step reasoning.

4. **extract_answer Function**: Parses the final answer from a given reasoning path.

5. **most_common Function**: Identifies the most frequent answer among all generated paths, serving as the consistency metric.

## Benefits and Performance

The Self-Consistency technique has shown significant improvements over standard Chain-of-Thought prompting:

- 11% average gain on Mathematical Problem Solving tasks
- 3% gain on Commonsense Reasoning tasks
- 6% gain on Multi-Hop Reasoning tasks

These improvements stem from the technique's ability to overcome potential errors or biases in any single reasoning attempt, leading to more robust and accurate results across a variety of complex reasoning tasks.

## Conclusion

Self-Consistency represents a powerful enhancement to prompting techniques for LLMs. By leveraging multiple reasoning paths and aggregating results, it achieves more reliable and accurate outcomes for complex reasoning tasks. This approach showcases the potential for improving LLM performance without the need for model retraining or fine-tuning, opening up new possibilities in the field of prompt engineering.

## Problem Statement

Let's use the following problem:

"If a train travels at 60 miles per hour, how far will it travel in 2.5 hours?"

## Step 1: Generate Multiple Reasoning Paths

The LLM is prompted to solve this problem multiple times (let's say 5 times) using Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Here are potential outputs:

### Path 1:
1. The train's speed is 60 miles per hour.
2. The time of travel is 2.5 hours.
3. Distance = Speed × Time
4. Distance = 60 × 2.5
5. Distance = 150 miles
Therefore, the answer is 150 miles.

### Path 2:
1. We need to multiply the speed by the time.
2. Speed is 60 mph and time is 2.5 hours.
3. 60 × 2.5 = 120 + 30 = 150
Therefore, the answer is 150 miles.

### Path 3:
1. In 1 hour, the train travels 60 miles.
2. In 2 hours, it would travel 120 miles.
3. In the remaining 0.5 hours, it travels half of 60, which is 30 miles.
4. Total distance = 120 + 30 = 150 miles
Therefore, the answer is 150 miles.

### Path 4:
1. Let's break it down:
   - For 2 hours: 60 × 2 = 120 miles
   - For 0.5 hours: 60 × 0.5 = 30 miles
2. Total: 120 + 30 = 150 miles
Therefore, the answer is 150 miles.

### Path 5:
1. Distance = Rate × Time
2. Rate = 60 mph
3. Time = 2.5 hours
4. Distance = 60 × 2.5
5. Distance = 150 miles
Therefore, the answer is 150 miles.

## Step 2: Extract Answers

From each path, we extract the final answer:

1. 150 miles
2. 150 miles
3. 150 miles
4. 150 miles
5. 150 miles

## Step 3: Determine Most Consistent Answer

In this case, all paths led to the same answer of 150 miles. The Self-Consistency technique would confidently return this as the final answer.

## Analysis

This example demonstrates several key aspects of the Self-Consistency technique:

1. **Multiple Approaches**: Each path takes a slightly different approach to solving the problem, showcasing how the technique explores various reasoning strategies.

2. **Consistency**: In this case, all paths arrived at the same answer, providing high confidence in the result. In real-world scenarios, there might be some variation, and the most frequent answer would be chosen.

3. **Robustness**: If one path had made a calculation error, the consensus from the other paths would likely override it, demonstrating the technique's robustness to individual mistakes.

4. **Verification**: The consistency across multiple paths serves as a form of self-verification, increasing confidence in the final answer.

In more complex problems, the benefits of Self-Consistency become even more apparent, as it can navigate ambiguities and catch errors that might persist in a single reasoning attempt.
